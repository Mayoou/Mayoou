👋 Welcome to Thomas's GitHub Profile aka. @Mayoou, a back-end rookie developer !

----------------------------------------

🚀 Following a professional retraining and after obtaining my license of "Developer - Full-stack web applications" within Le Wagon Marseille, I was able to acquire the working methodologies and the basics of the business. Anxious to learn more, I am integrating for the next two years the MScPro of Epitech Marseille.
So I am looking for an alternation in web development and/or DevOps that I could start during the month of August 2023. 

----------------------------------------

🌟 My hard skills :

Javascript (& Stimulus)

HTML5

CSS3 (& SCSS)

Command-Line Interface on Ubuntu

Deployment Heroku

Github & Teamworking
