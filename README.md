👋 Welcome to Thomas's GitHub Profile, a back-end rookie developer !

----------------------------------------

🚀 Currently in full professional conversion in this beautiful year 2022! I decided to follow the bootcamp of Wagon Marseille 🚂, to make a first step in the fabulous Dev' domain and thus launch the career I have always dreamed of! Passionate since always about tech, today I decided to cross the threshold and make it my job.

🌟 My hard skills :

  -> Ruby & Ruby on Rails ❤️                   -> Deployment Heroku
  -> Javascript (Stimulus)                     -> Github & Teamworking
  -> HTML5                                     -> PostgreSQL
  -> CSS3 (& SCSS)                             -> Bootsrap 💩
